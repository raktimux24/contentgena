# Implementation Plan for Blog & Social Content Generator App

This plan outlines the step-by-step approach to building the AI-powered content generator application, based on the provided PRD. Each step includes tasks, milestones, and considerations to guide the development process.

---

## Step 1: UI Design & Authentication Setup (Weeks 1-2)

### Tasks:
- **Design UI Mockups & Wireframes:**
  - Create detailed wireframes for all screens (Landing Page, Authentication Flow, Dashboard, Content Generation Flow, Content Detail View, User Profile Management).
  - Ensure the design follows the Neobrutalism style with bold typography, minimal elements, and muted colors.

- **Set Up Project Environment:**
  - Initialize a new React project using Vite and TypeScript.
  - Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Establish folder structure for components, pages, and assets.

- **Implement Authentication:**
  - Integrate Firebase Authentication.
    - Build Login Page (email/password, “Forgot Password”, “Sign Up” links).
    - Build Registration Page (user sign-up form).
    - Build Password Recovery Page (password reset functionality).
  - Set up routing for authentication pages.
  - Test authentication flow (registration, login, logout, password recovery).

## Step 2: Content Generation Backend & API Workflows (Weeks 3-4)

### Tasks:
- **Set Up Buildship Workflows:**
  - Ensure the Buildship workflow is fully configured to:
    - Parse URL sources.
    - Call the Gemini API for blog generation.
    - Call the ChatGPT API for tweet thread and LinkedIn post generation.
  - Test the workflow manually to validate API integrations.

- **Develop API Endpoint:**
  - Create a REST API endpoint that triggers the Buildship workflow when the content generation form is submitted.
  - Ensure that the endpoint accepts the Topic and URL sources as payload.
  - Implement error handling for:
    - Invalid URLs.
    - API failures (Gemini/ChatGPT).

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Develop the Input Form Screen to capture Topic and up to 3 URL sources.
  - On form submission, trigger the API endpoint.
  - Display inline validations and error messages for user inputs.

- **Loading/Processing UI:**
  - Create a Loading/Processing screen with an animation/progress indicator.
  - Ensure users see a clear status message while content is being generated.

## Step 3: Dashboard & Content History Implementation (Weeks 5-6)

### Tasks:
- **Dashboard Overview Screen:**
  - Build the Dashboard Overview screen to display:
    - Recent activity snapshot (latest content generation results).
    - Content generation stats (number of blogs, tweet threads, LinkedIn posts).
    - A “Generate New Content” CTA.
  - Implement responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

- **Content History/List View:**
  - Create a page to list all generated content stored in Firebase Firestore.
    - Implement search and filter functionalities (e.g., by date, content type).
    - Include an empty state view for users with no content.
  - Implement action buttons for each content item (view, copy, delete).

- **Content Detail View:**
  - Develop a detailed view for a selected content package.
    - Use tabs or section navigation to separate Blog, Tweet Thread, and LinkedIn Post.
    - Include an action toolbar for “Edit Externally,” “Copy,” “Share,” and “Delete.”

- **Firebase Integration:**
  - Set up Firebase Firestore for content storage.
  - Ensure generated content from the backend is saved to Firebase.
  - Implement retrieval functions for displaying saved content in the Dashboard.

---

## Step 4: User Settings, Profile Management & Final Testing (Weeks 7-8)

### Tasks:
- **User Profile Management:**
  - Build the Profile Page where users can view and update their account details.
  - Implement profile picture upload/change functionality (if applicable).
  - Optionally add a link to update the password.

- **Theme Toggle Integration:**
  - Implement a global dark/light mode toggle:
    - Add toggle in the header and optionally in the Settings page.
    - Use Tailwind CSS theming support to switch styles dynamically.
  
- **Error Handling & Performance Tuning:**
  - Implement comprehensive error handling across API calls.
  - Optimize API calls and Firebase interactions for performance.
  - Add client-side validations to improve UX.

- **Testing:**
  - Perform unit tests on individual components.
  - Conduct integration tests for end-to-end flows (authentication, content generation, dashboard interactions).
  - Validate responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

## Step 5: Soft Launch & User Feedback (Week 9)

### Tasks:
- **Deploy the Application:**
  - Set up deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) for the frontend.
  - Ensure Firebase configuration is production-ready.

- **Soft Launch:**
  - Release a beta version to a limited audience.
  - Monitor performance metrics, API usage, and user engagement.

- **Collect User Feedback:**
  - Provide a feedback form or integrate a simple survey.
  - Identify issues and gather improvement suggestions.

- **Plan Iterations:**
  - Prioritize fixes based on user feedback.
  - Plan additional features for future releases (e.g., premium API usage, advanced customization).

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Security:**
  - Enforce rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
  - Secure API endpoints and Firebase access rules.
  
- **Scalability:**
  - Monitor Firebase usage and plan for potential scaling needs.
  - Consider caching strategies for high-traffic endpoints.

- **Documentation:**
  - Document code, APIs, and workflows.
  - Maintain an internal wiki for team collaboration and future maintenance.
