Blog & Social Content Generator App

TL;DR

This application enables users to generate high-quality content—including blog posts, tweet threads, and LinkedIn posts—based on a single input form. It leverages APIs like Gemini and ChatGPT to automate content creation and integrates with Firebase for authentication, storage, and data management. The platform provides a clean, Neobrutalist UI, a user dashboard, and seamless content retrieval.

Problem Statement

Content creation is time-consuming, requiring extensive research, writing, and adaptation for multiple platforms. Many users struggle with repurposing long-form content into social media-friendly formats efficiently. This app solves that problem by automating the entire content generation process, allowing users to input a topic and source materials, and receive a fully structured blog post, tweet thread, and LinkedIn post.

Goals

Business Goals
	1.	Provide a fast, AI-powered content generation tool that increases productivity for creators, marketers, and businesses.
	2.	Drive user engagement by offering a seamless, end-to-end content creation experience.
	3.	Monetization (future consideration): Offer freemium plans with premium features such as advanced customization, additional API credits, or premium templates.
	4.	Position the app as a cutting-edge tool in the content automation space with a visually distinctive Neobrutalist UI.

User Goals
	1.	Generate high-quality, structured content quickly.
	2.	Automate content adaptation for different platforms (blogs, tweets, LinkedIn).
	3.	Save and retrieve previously generated content in a well-organized dashboard.
	4.	Maintain creative control with options to edit, copy, and share generated content.

Non-Goals
	1.	Manual content writing or in-app editing—users can copy content for external editing.
	2.	Image or video generation—this version focuses solely on text-based content.
	3.	Integrations with external CMS or scheduling tools (e.g., WordPress, Buffer) in the first release.

User Stories

Core User Flow - Content Generation

	•	As a user, I want to see a loading screen during content generation, so that I know the system is processing my request.
	•	As a user, I want to view, copy, and save the generated content for later use.

User Management & Storage
	•	As a user, I want to register and log in securely, so that I can save my generated content.
	•	As a user, I want to view my content history, so that I can revisit and reuse previous outputs.
	•	As a user, I want to delete old content if I no longer need it.

Dashboard & UI
	•	As a user, I want to have a clean, structured dashboard that shows all my past content.
	•	As a user, I want a dark mode/light mode toggle for better readability.

User Experience (UX) Flow
	1.	User lands on the homepage → Reads about features → Clicks “Get Started”
	2.	User registers/logs in via Firebase Authentication
	3.	User accesses the dashboard (empty on first visit)
	4.	User starts content generation:
	•	Fills out the form: Topic + 3 URL sources
	•	Clicks Generate
	5.	Backend triggers workflow:
	•	Parses URLs
	•	Sends data to Gemini API for blog generation
	•	Sends blog to ChatGPT API for tweet thread & LinkedIn post
	6.	User sees a loading animation while content is generated
	7.	Results page displays generated content → Options to copy, share, or save
	8.	Generated content is saved to Firebase → Available in User Dashboard
	9.	User revisits dashboard → Views past content

2. Content Generation Engine
	•	Input Form: Topic + 3 URL sources
	•	Backend Workflow (Buildship + APIs):
	•	Parses URLs
	•	Calls Gemini API (for blog)
	•	Calls ChatGPT API (for tweets & LinkedIn)
	•	Output Processing: Displays content in UI

3. Dashboard & Content History
	•	Store generated content in Firebase

	2.	Content Retention: % of users who return to access saved content
	3.	API Performance: Avg. time taken to generate content
	4.	User Satisfaction: Feedback & ratings from users

Technical Considerations

Frontend
	•	React (Vite) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS for performance and scalability
	•	Responsive design optimized for mobile & desktop

Backend
	•	Buildship workflows triggered via API
